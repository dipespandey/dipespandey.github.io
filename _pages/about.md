I am a novice programmer and a life-time learner. I am originally from Nepal, but I have been living in Norway for the past {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2021 }} years. In my current role,I mainly work on Full-Stack Development with Python/Typescript/Django/FastAPI/Node.JS and HTMX/React, but also like to fiddle around with data engineering, Machine Learning, and LLMs from time to time in my free time. Currently, I am learning the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

I am passionate about building end-to-end products and getting involved early in the development process. My [projects page](/projects) showcases several personal tools and platforms I've built - some generating revenue, others in active development. I enjoy exploring new technologies and frameworks which I have documented in my [blog posts](/blog) covering topics from physics to LLMs to normal tech stuff.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading (check out my [reading list](/reading)), playing sports, or cooking or watching movies.
