I am a novice programmer and a life-time learner. I mainly work on Backend Development with Python and Node.JS, but also fiddle around with NLP, and Machine Learning.
Right now, I work full-time as a software engineer for [Retriever](https://retrievergroup.com) where I mainly build data pipelines to process media data. I also work as a tech volunteer at [Radionova](https://radionova.no), a student-run online radio based in Oslo. Apart from these, I manage a few of my pet projects which I like working on every now and then.

I am quite interested in building end-to-end products given an idea, and usually like to be involved with problem solving during the inception phase. I have managed to build my personal tools and platforms that are currently generating some revenue, while some are still looking for customers or still in the progress of development. I consider myself a novice in programming with a curious mind. I am always open to learn new skills one way or the other as long as the challenge interests me.  

This blog provides sort of a dump of my mind. I hope to connect with like-minded individuals through this. If you have any suggestions or just want to connect, please free to contact me. 

Thanks for reading!
