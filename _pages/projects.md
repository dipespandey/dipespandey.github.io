description: In my free time, I like to fiddle around with a few projects of my own. Over the years, I have managed to make a few friends who are interested in problem solving just like me. As a result, we have created a few projects, some of which a few customers, while others are work in progress. In recent times, I have been getting more interested in open source projects and contributing to them. <br><br>Please feel free to comment below if you face any issues while trying them out.
