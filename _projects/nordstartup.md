[Nordstartup](https://nordstartup.com) is a job board focused on remote jobs in Europe, US and Canada. It scrapes job data everyday from several remote job boards like otta, 80000jobs, weworkremotely, etc. and shows them in a single place with intuitive filters and sorting options.
The idea came out because I was tired of going through several websites to find remote jobs with the same filters and queries. So, 
I wanted to build something that have filters that suit me.
