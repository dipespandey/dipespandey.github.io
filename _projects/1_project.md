[Haifix](https://stats.haifix.com) is a SAAS platform that allows non-traders to earn some passive income by investing in the platform. I collaborated with some experienced forex traders where they build the mechanism to generate daily profitable signals, and I created a platform to 
monitize the system on a commission-based model. 

Current status: 8 onboarded investors with a total investment of â‚¬80k.
