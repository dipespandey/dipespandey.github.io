The most recurring thought I get these days is that **"life is short"**. This can mean different things for different people. When we hear this, often times people are talking about how you should not take life too seriously, and you should have as much fun as you can. I can totally understand where this comes from. And yes, we should have fun. But I usually get stuck in a dilemma when I think about it. Does that mean I should be focusing most of my time to ensure my imminent future is going to be fun(depending on how I define fun) or should I play the large-scale game.
