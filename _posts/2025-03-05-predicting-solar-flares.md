There are several solar storm incidents like this that happen every year causing disruptions to GPS data. In this post, we will try to look at the history of such solar storms and see if we can predict them using machine learning.

### What are Solar Flares?
Solar flares are sudden eruptions of energy from the sun that can cause disruptions to Earth's magnetic field and communication systems. Understanding and predicting solar flares is crucial for space weather forecasting and ensuring the safety of astronauts and satellites.

I work as a software engineer at Nofence, a company that relies heavily on accurate GPS data to provide geo-fencing services. 

### GPS Data
GPS or Global Positioning System is a satellite-based navigation system that provides location and time information to users on Earth. It is used in a wide range of applications, from navigation and mapping to asset tracking and fleet management.
This is how GPS works:

### What is a Solar Flare?
The sun is a star that emits light and heat. It is made up of plasma, which is a hot, ionized gas. The sun's surface is covered by a layer of plasma called the photosphere. There is a magnetic field in the sun's photosphere that is generated by the movement of the plasma. The earth also has a magnetic field because of the movement of the molten iron in the earth's core. On regular days, the magnetic fields of the sun and the earth cancel each other out. However, on days when the sun's magnetic field is facing the earth's magnetic field, the magnetic fields of the sun and the earth add up and cause a solar flare.

### How solar flares affect GPS data?
The magnetic field of the sun can affect the GPS data by causing errors in the time it takes for the GPS signal to travel from the satellite to the receiver. This is because the magnetic field of the sun can cause the GPS signal to travel slower or faster than it should.

So, if we can predict the solar flares, we can predict the errors in the GPS data and we can use that to improve the accuracy of the GPS data.

### Predicting solar flares
We will start by looking at a [dataset](https://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/solar/data/data-comp-2020/) of solar flares from the past and try to find a pattern in the data. For this, we will use the Kaggle dataset which contains data on solar flares automatically detected and classified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) constellation of GOES satellites based on their peak flux in soft X-ray wavelengths on a logarithmic scale as A-, B- ,C- , M-, and X-class solar flares, from weakest to the strongest.

Let's do some exploratory data analysis on the dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('solar_flares.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
df.head()
```
