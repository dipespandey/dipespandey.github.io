I am a novice in data science and writing in general, but the key is to never stop learning. With the internet providing almost everything we can think of, it's easier to learn anything than it has ever been. The idea is to reflect back on what skills I am already familiar with and what I want to add to my arsenal while keeping track of everything in this blog. In this blog, I intend to write about my learnings, how I do them, including data science, life skills and metalearning itself.

To introduce myself, I am a master procrastinator based in Nepal who works remotely for a company called [MyriadX](https://myriadx.com) by day, and learning/building stuffs at night. At MyriadX, my day to day works involve working on the API for the martech-adtech intersection platform that we are building. It's fun, I get to work with some awesome people from around the world. Yes, I still do Full-Stack Development, but want to switch over to Data Science (who doesn't ?). 
  
About switching towards Data Science, this is something everyone is doing, no matter what background they are
from. I am currently in that path, starting from the ground up. Through this blog, I plan on covering the topics that are hard to find in a common place in the web, but are super important to grok data science.  

In case you want to know more about my background, [here's my CV](/assets/dipesh_pandey_resume.pdf).
  
Thanks for reading!
