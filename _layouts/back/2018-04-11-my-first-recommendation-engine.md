## The Problem

This is a part of my college minor project in 3rd Year. We had to create a full-fledged project that touches machine learning. Because my knowledge on machine learning was very fledgling, I decided to create something basic, that would help me get into the field, and at the same time improve my research and documentation skills.
The project I undertook was 'Movie Recommendation System'. This quickly led me to know about 'the Netflix Prize' where Netflix awarded two algorithms $100,000 for improving their recommendation accuracy by 0.1 %. This idea of how even a small improvement in the accuracy is so useful to a company fascinated me, and I decided to implement one of those two algorithms, 'Matrix Factorization using Stochastic Gradient Descent'.
