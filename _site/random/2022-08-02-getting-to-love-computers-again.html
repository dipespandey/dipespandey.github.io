  <h2 id="how-it-all-started">How it all started?</h2>
<p>It’s two months after I finish my masters degree in Norway. I have already started with a job I always wanted in a good enterprise. Things were going well, I was slowly starting to understand what people mean when they talk about work-life balance. Put your best work in the core working hours, and use the remaining part of your day to focus on self-growth. Sounds pretty simple, doesn’t it? Actually, it’s not that simple for someone who is not good at sticking to the plan in life. Well, I am that someone. I had given up on this idea of sticking to a plan long ago. These days, I am just trying to focus on doing things and experiencing new things.</p>

<p>So, although I had a job, I was not satisfied with it. It felt like I could do much more. The job gave me enough money, and I could learn from some experienced developers in Norway and other countries. But, there was some time I could spend to do even more things that I like. That’s how I found a volunteer/job opportunity at Radio Nova. It’s a student-run online radio that lies at the heart of Oslo in Majorstuen.</p>
