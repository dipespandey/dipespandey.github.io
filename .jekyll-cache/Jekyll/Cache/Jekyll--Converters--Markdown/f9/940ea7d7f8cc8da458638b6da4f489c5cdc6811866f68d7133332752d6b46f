<p>I am a novice programmer and a life-time learner. I mainly work on NLP, blockchain and full-stack end-to-end products. 
My hobbies include learning the startup culture, playing/watching football and cricket.
Right now, I am a full-time masters student at NTNU, Norway. I am specializing in blockchain technologies, with the 
area of work being transaction analysis and smart contracts.</p>

<p>If you think I can help you in any of your software product that touches NLP, blockchain or is data-intensive, I am easy to find.
