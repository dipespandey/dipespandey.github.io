<p>Itâ€™s two months after I finish my masters degree in Norway. I have already started with a job I always wanted in a good enterprise. Things were going well, I was slowly starting to understand what people mean when they talk about work-life balance. Put your best work in the core working hours, and use the remaining part of your day to focus on self-growth. Sounds pretty simple, doesnâ€™t it? Actually, itâ€™s not that simple for someone who is not good at sticking to the plan in life. Well, I am that someone. I had given up on this idea of sticking to a plan long ago. These days, I am just trying to focus on doing things and experiencing new things.</p>
